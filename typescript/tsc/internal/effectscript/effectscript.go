// Package effectscript compiles EffectScript (.es) files.
//
// EffectScript is TypeScript syntax in which every function is an Effect: a
// call to a function that returns an Effect runs it, and the compiler infers
// each function's Effect<A, E, R>. The package plugs into upstream tsc only
// through Register* hooks, which it calls from init; tsc/cmd/tsc imports it
// for that side effect.
